    <h3>Weird computer issues [7/23/22]</h3>
    <p>I've had some weird power issues with this computer.</p>
    <p>
      The power button just doesn't turn it on most of the time, and sleep
      doesn't work right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I've had 2 MEMORY_MANAGEMENT BSODs and lots of firefox crashing for
      some reason. I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic and it's all fine, but
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it's my SSD? The SSD I have right now sucks, and I have a 512GB one
      on it's way.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, that's weird.</p>
